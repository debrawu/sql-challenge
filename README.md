Above, we can find the salary disbursement within the company. Most salaries are within the $40,000-$45000.00 per year range and we can see that salaries are not equally disbursed and there is a left skew on salaries. This is probably as the majority of employees are more entry level, hence given an entry level salary, whereas the managers and executives, which are fewer in the group have higher salaries.
